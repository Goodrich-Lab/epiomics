Description: A collection of fast and flexible functions for analyzing
    omics data in observational studies. Multiple different approaches for
    integrating environmental/genetic factors, omics data, and/or
    phenotype data are implemented. This includes functions for performing
    omics wide association studies with one or more variables of interest
    as the exposure or outcome; a function for performing a meet in the
    middle analysis for linking exposures, omics, and outcomes (as
    described by Chadeau-Hyam et al., (2010)
    <doi:10.3109/1354750X.2010.533285>); and a function for performing a
    mixtures analysis across all omics features using quantile-based
    g-Computation (as described by Keil et al., (2019)
    <doi:10.1289/EHP5838>).
