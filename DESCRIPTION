Description: A collection of fast and flexible functions for analyzing omics
    data in observational studies. Multiple different approaches for integrating 
    environmental/genetic factors, omics data, and/or penotype data are 
    implemented. This includes functions for performing omics wide association 
    studies with one or more variables of interest as the exposure or outcome; 
    a function for performing a meet in the middle analysis for linking 
    exposures, omics, and outcomes (as described by Chadeau-Hyam et al., (2010) 
    <doi:10.3109/1354750X.2010.533285>); and a function for performing a 
    mixtures analysis across all omics features using quantile-based 
    g-Computation (as described by Keil et al., (2019) <doi:10.1289/EHP5838>).
