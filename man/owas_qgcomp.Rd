\title{Perform 'omics wide association study using qgcomp}
\usage{
owas_qgcomp(df, expnms, omics, covars = NULL, q = 4, confidence_level = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Dataset}

\item{expnms}{Name of the exposures. Can be either continuous or
dichotomous. For dichotomous variables, must set \code{q} to
"NULL", and values must be either 0/1.}

\item{omics}{Names of all omics features in the dataset}

\item{covars}{Names of covariates (can be NULL)}

\item{q}{NULL or number of quantiles used to create quantile indicator
variables representing the exposure variables. Defaults to 4If NULL, then
qgcomp proceeds with un-transformed version of exposures in the input
datasets (useful if data are already transformed, or for performing standard
g-computation).}

\item{confidence_level}{Confidence level for marginal significance
(defaults to 0.95, or an alpha of 0.05)}
}
\value{
A data frame with 6 columns:
feature_name: name of the omics feature
psi: the model estimate for the feature. For linear models, this is the
beta; for logistic models, this is the log odds.
se: Standard error of the estimate
p_value: p-value for the estimate
adjusted_pval: FDR adjusted p-value
threshold: Marginal significance, based on unadjusted p-values
}
\description{
Implements an omics wide association study using QGComp to model
associations of exposure mixtures with each individual 'omics feature as an
outcome 'omics data as either the dependent variable. Allows for either
continuous or dichotomous outcomes, and provides the option to adjust for
covariates.
